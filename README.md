# demo-express-finale

Simple demonstration of an Express app using Finale-REST to generate REST endpoints from Sequelize (ORM) models.

## 1. Installation and usage

As it is only a demonstration, and there is no other purpose behind this project, we only need to download and run the example.

```bash
# Download the package from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/allnulled/demo-express-finale

# Go to the directory:
cd demo-express-finale

# Run all the tests (it will install the dependencies automatically):
npm run test
```
